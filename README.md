# Calculator ðŸ§®

**Description:** Developed a command-line calculator application using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and supports parentheses for complex expressions. Implemented error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios, ensuring robust functionality.

**Key Contributions:**
- **Functional Design:** Designed the calculator to accept user input via the command line, parsing expressions to evaluate mathematical operations efficiently.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling to manage edge cases, including invalid syntax and division by zero errors, ensuring reliability.
- **Modular Approach:** Organized the code into modular functions for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), enhancing maintainability and readability.
- **Testing and Validation:** Conducted thorough testing to validate the calculator's accuracy across a range of input scenarios, ensuring consistent and correct results.
- **Documentation:** Created comprehensive documentation detailing usage instructions and the project's design rationale, aiding future maintenance and development efforts.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Git (version control), Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Outcome:**
The calculator project demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, algorithmic thinking, and software development principles. It showcased effective problem-solving skills and attention to detail in handling complex mathematical operations within a user-friendly interface.
